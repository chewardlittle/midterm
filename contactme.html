	<p> 	It's hard out there for a millennial who wasn't raised with TV and got their first smart phone ever last year. I feel an enormous disconnect between myself and all things real in 2016. I wonder how post-humanism can exist when the possibility to remove oneself from networking technology is still viable. Then again, I wonder if I have ever really known a time void of this networking activity. And with that in mind, how I know of no other world but this one in front of me buzzing with clicks and bathed in radio waves, I find myself playing with questions too large to handle properly. I want to know how and if the internet can be used to incite change.  </p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph1">
	<p> 	I often perceive the internet and its LITERALLY INFINITE FACETS as harmful to the human experience but also recognize it as a part of that experience. The internet is a massive agent of change and enervates large groups and systems of people into voicing their opinions and demanding difference. But the internet is also, on an individual level, a huge barrier for one learning about themselves, for changing and growing as an individual person (you are taken away from books, nature, and your own thoughts that are specific to you, not a part of an archetypal story model invented by film and television.) Thus, how can groups of people grow to understand each other as a means of ending a fight when use of the internet and influence by it leads to people who only know to demand but never compromise. How can a device that gives us the ability to change the world for the better limit the human capacity for understanding that need in the first place?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph2">
	<p> 	The internet is most important as a platform for social and political change, to allow citizens to liberate themselves and ask of the government and the global community for aide. But the internet serves more than this one function. In fact, to allow for that networking function to be a viable means of discussion of human events and communities it also serves as the source of information from which this discourse can be had. Like yin and yang these aspects of the internet are inseparable from each other and cannot exist without a counterpart. In theory the internet presents an ideal system for generating change, but in reality it is a free form chaos.  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph3">
	<p>		In a time when any person with the technological means can express their experience on a globally accessible platform, what or who can serve as a form of governance? One that can institute a system so that real depictions of the world are presented rather than falsities, twisted realities that hold the potential to serve as fact or instigate emotional reaction. And is this ethical? Is there really any one or any thing that can mediate the human experience, real or not, factual or fiction? And amongst this mass of information how can one derive meaning from static text, words not stimulus of senses? </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph4">
	<p> 	Our brains, so good at emoting, at processing information, we feel so viscerally to sentences and paragraphs that breach the conduit systems of our psyches and land at our own experiences and memories that somehow feel shared. And at what quantity and speed the internet presents this word to brain to emotion quality! So easily scrolled through, marketed and advertised to our direct needs, the internet not only allows us access to information but it caters that data to each individual. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph5">
	<p> 	Once, television dictated the national experience, or the local experience with public broadcast television. The entire country watched as John F Kennedy addressed the nation, thousands of people have shared experiences from growing up watching the same television shows of which there were far fewer. Now there are infinite means to reach the end of this stimulation. But hardly any are shared, and that which is shared is shared amongst like-minded people. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph6">
	<p>		As the internet evolved to cater to our brain’s growing addiction to emotional stimulus so did the behavior of internet users. Trolls emerged but not just trolls, the use of cyberbullying and virtual aggression (flaiming) became a commonplace aspect of internet behavior. Suddenly the world’s access to an individuals opinions and vice versa created a platform for the critique of ideas, systems, and art forms not previously available. An interesting dynamic was born through this critical aspect of human nature and its rampant access to the internet, the dynamic between human beings and other human beings and the shift to avatar to avatar communication. With social norms changing and developing to include relationships and interactions over the internet which is certainly not a face-to-face exchange, the way people view themselves as individuals shifts as well. Emotional connection expands and the parts of our brains or parts of our human nature that desire this constant attention grabbing and stylishly presented stimulus have modified themselves greatly.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph7">
	<p> 	Virtual perception is a huge facet of internet using culture. The avatar or a profile picture can never truly express a human being--reduced to binary and pixels, the ability to understand other people diminishes as well. Constant access to television and film and the massive diversity and expansion that occurred within those art forms allowed another leisure outlet for citizens who have been geared their whole lives to seek comfort. People develop greater interest in the dramatic and effervescent lives of television characters than in their own day-to-day experiences. Thanks to the pattern seeking qualities of our right brains we associate our own interactions and relationships to those on screen. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph8">
	<p> 	Our own understanding of ourselves slowly evaporates as we lose grip on the people around us, beginning not just to compare ourselves and our relationships to characters but emulating them and their often dramatized behavior. Books once allowed for individual introspection and, indicative of a quality rarely seen nowadays, the ability to be only in the company of yourself. The serene meditation of the natural world falls away to screens emitting blue and yellow light through tiny diodes a miniscule fragment of the population understands. Music bursts through internet radio on cell phones, Bluetooth speakers, computers silently whirring amongst the chorus of recycled melodies targeted to the unknowing children of wealthy businessmen. The whole world bathes in radio waves and applauds at the loudest din, boos to the sound of other people possibly booing in the distance, and orgasms to virtual flesh, in virtual rooms that could easily be in the next room, but fortunately, the internet does not open that door. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph9">
	<p> 	Instead, the sun sets on rooms that remain unlit because the owner is lying prostrate on a bed, seemingly praying to whatever god inhabits the iPhones vessel. We tap, like, hate, love, live, and die on the internet. We feel other people’s wounds through their words and videos and songs the same way Plato watched light flicker on the walls of his cave but it is always diluted, less than the real thing. We try to solve the worlds problems through the massive networking ability of the internet but by doing so, in trying to stay up to date on issues, world events, national politics, artistic movements, literature, we cloud our abilities to see the physical world around us. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph10">
	<p> 	The internet allows humans to share experiences but it lessens the importance of personal experience, of personal growth, of manifesting individual development as a means of combatting social issues and instigating change. The allegiances formed by the internet are powerful but they have passed through a medium, lost heat in energy transformation, and they do not guarantee perfect assimilation from internet to reality. The internet creates the illusion of unity, community, friendship, allegiance, all while one sits alone in a dark room, the only light bouncing off walls is that which was chosen by the user but chosen for picking by an algorithm, data, a very small and beautiful, invisible computer. A computer whose brain is a stark copy of our own, rather than creating infinite connections between neurons, each microprocessor, through the movement of electrons, chooses between the most simple of invented human dichotomies, 0 or 1 in order to communicate, to carry out functions and operate. Just as the information generated by internet users plays to the right side of our brains intent on feeling and creating content, the technology required to display accessible programs and access data for those exact purposes, is geared quite in the opposite direction, more towards the left brains analytic qualities. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph11">
	<p> 	The computer by which the internet operates is the dark yin to the internet’s ostentatious yang. The internet could not exist with out computer processers processing data to be transmitted to one another but computers certainly did exist before the internet. Strangely enough, their function because of the internet has expanded enormously. Personal computing is one of many ways in which computer processers not involving the internet are used in the 21st century. Yet, the science of computers and the technology used to create them is hardly understood and not widely accessible to the greater masses. As technologies advance devices become more and more easy to use, an aspect of this convenience is the hiding away of computers and complex machinery and placing in their stead, shiny distractions for the average consumer to choose between at purchase. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph12">
	<p> 	The growing divide between understanding the emotional and intuitive side of the internet and the complicated and inaccessible world of computers only deepens with time and use. Just as the imagined internet communities do not translate fully to real life, and how visual art, song, video, media expose and promote the experiences of other humans, they do not fully capture nor portray the intended expression nor the full essence of the form. Just as the internet serves as an incredibly powerful tool to incite social change and improve the lives and well beings of humans world-wide, it’s own excessive use and life time exposure can be held responsible for creating unneeded anxieties and harmful societal norms as culture in every form molds around the novelty of constant communication. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="paragraph13">
	<p> 	These dichotomies present the same human question, they stem from the same spiritual root leading to no answer. Playing with why or what or how seems almost too specific. Instead, I settle for does. Does it change? Does it ever change? Will people always consume until it is too late? Too late to correct the mistakes that were made while the world looked into cyberspace and saw themselves in its reflection? The answer is hidden somewhere between those dichotomies, somewhere between knowing how to use a computer and knowing how a computer works, between uniting for social change and trying to be change, between left brain and right, perhaps even, somewhere between zero and one.
